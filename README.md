# Can Large Language Model be a Gaslighter?

## Overview
ðŸ”¥ This is a repository for our paper ([ Can Large Language Model be a Gaslighter?]()).

>In this work, we develop a PAED dataset, PersonaExt, with 1,896 re-annotated triplets and 6,357 corrected utterance-triplet pairs. 
>We present a generation-based framework for zero-shot PAED. A novel HNS strategy, Meta-VAE sampler with CSC, is presented to enhance the performance of our model.
>Our model achieves better results than strong baselines in zero-shot PAED and negative sampling.
